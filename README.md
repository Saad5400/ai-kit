# saad/ai-kit

Shared AI infrastructure for **catodemy**, **s-grade** and **uqucc-laravel**. Public repo, consumed as a composer VCS package; the sole requirer of `laravel/ai` and `laravel/mcp` — apps depend on this instead.

This README describes the finished product. Owner decision record (the authority): [`docs/DECISIONS.md`](docs/DECISIONS.md) · working milestone plan: [`docs/PLAN.md`](docs/PLAN.md)

## Modules

Toggled per app via `config/ai-kit.php` → `modules.*`:

| Module | Default | Contents |
|---|---|---|
| `gateway` | on | Canonical `ReasoningOpenRouterGateway`, resilience policy (timeouts, retries, fallback chains, circuit breaker), drift-guard |
| `agents` | on | Agent ↔ MCP tool adapters, Capability bridge |
| `conversations` | on | `EncryptedConversationStore`, retention policies, tool traces |
| `streaming` | on | `TurnRunner` + sinks, resumable SSE buffer (queue-worker generation) |
| `approvals` | on | `Capability` + `Effect`, classified pause on laravel/ai `Approvable`, undo ledger + `UndoTurn`, `AskUser` |
| `attachments` | on | 3-stage extraction pipeline, extract-on-upload, sha-256 cache |
| `usage` | on | `TurnSpend`, canonical usage events, turn traces + TTFT metrics |
| `catalog` | on | `CatalogSource` (config and/or DB), `ai-kit:sync-models` |
| `safety` | on | Central kill switch, `BudgetGuard`, concurrency caps, degraded mode |
| `rag` | off | Hybrid retriever (pgvector + RRF), embedder/chunker |
| `credits` | off | Generalized wallets, `CreditCalculator`, idempotent meter base |

`Saad\AiKit\Testing` ships fakes + exported contract test suites for apps (dev-only, not a toggle).

## The wire contract

One turn is one SSE stream of `event: NAME\ndata: {json}\n\n` frames, written by `SseStream` and folded out of the provider stream by `StreamEventMapper`. The inline path and the resumable `TurnBuffer` path emit the same sequence for the same turn, so a client works against either.

| Event | Payload | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `delta` | `{text}` | Model text. Deltas concatenate. |
| `reasoning` | `{text}` | Thinking. **On by default.** No start/end events — the client opens its block on the first `reasoning` and closes it on the first following `delta`, `tool` or terminal event. |
| `tool` | `{id, name, status: running\|done, successful?}` | **On by default.** Arguments and results never reach the wire; hook `ToolCall` server-side if an app wants more. |
| `approval` | `{kind, id, tool, title, destructive, undoable, editable, arguments, preview, reason}` | A paused turn's card, every trust-bearing field server-derived. `id` is the tool call's id, so a paused call's `running` chip folds into its card. |
| `question` | `{kind, id, question}` | An `AskUser` pause — answered, not approved. |
| `citations` | `{items}` | Post-stream, from a `beforeDone` hook. |
| `done` | app-assembled | **Terminal.** |
| `error` | `{message}` | **Terminal** — no `done` ever follows it. |

A turn ends with exactly one terminal event. Buffered frames are led by an `id:` line carrying the sequence number to resume from. Pre-flight failures are plain JSON at 503/429/422/402, discriminated client-side by `Content-Type`.

Opt out of the defaults per app with `$mapper->withoutReasoning()` / `->withoutToolEvents()`; replace them with `->onReasoning(...)` or `->on(ToolCall::class, ...)`.

## Frontend layer

The same repo ships the client half, so adopting the kit also gets an app its AI frontend:

```bash
npm install github:Saad5400/ai-kit#semver:^0.5.0
```

```ts
import { readSseStream } from '@saad5400/ai-kit/sse'
import { renderMarkdown } from '@saad5400/ai-kit/markdown'
import type { AiKitSseEvent } from '@saad5400/ai-kit/events'

import Markdown from '@saad5400/ai-kit/vue/Markdown.vue'          // uqucc
import Markdown from '@saad5400/ai-kit/svelte/Markdown.svelte'    // catodemy, s-grade

import '@saad5400/ai-kit/styles/prose.css'                        // optional
```

Contents: `events` (the table above, as TypeScript), `sse` (a dependency-free reader for POST-response streams — `EventSource` cannot send a body), `markdown` (unified + GFM, sanitized through DOMPurify, raw HTML escaped to literal text, every link `target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"`, plus a throttled `createLiveRenderer` for streaming), and thin `vue/` + `svelte/` components (`Markdown`, `ThinkingDisclosure`, `ToolChip`) styled only through CSS-variable hooks — look and feel stays per app.

`styles/prose.css` is optional and opt-in: a small flat prose sheet for `.ai-kit-markdown`, worth taking mainly because it uses logical properties throughout (`padding-inline-start`, `border-inline-start`, `text-align: start`), so Arabic replies lay out correctly with no mirrored RTL stylesheet. Map `--ai-kit-link`, `--ai-kit-border`, `--ai-kit-muted-bg` and `--ai-kit-muted` to your design tokens. An app with its own prose system should skip it.

It ships **source TypeScript with no build step**, so the consuming app's bundler compiles it. That means Vite (or an equivalent), and the package needs to reach the app's plugin pipeline rather than the dependency pre-bundler:

```js
// vite.config.js
optimizeDeps: { exclude: ['@saad5400/ai-kit'] },
ssr: { noExternal: ['@saad5400/ai-kit'] },   // Inertia SSR builds
```

## Development

```bash
composer install
composer test   # pest
composer lint   # pint --test

npm install
npm test        # vitest — js/core + a compile check on the components
```

Tests run on Orchestra Testbench; no live AI calls in CI (recorded fixtures only). The JS suite runs under jsdom, not happy-dom: happy-dom's `NodeIterator` makes DOMPurify strip the root element of every fragment, so the sanitizer under test would not be the sanitizer that ships.
